# Oscorp Capstone — Jiran Inventory Intelligence
# Jiran — AI-Assisted Inventory Optimization & Retailer Marketplace

Jiran is a centralized, web-based platform designed for small and mid-sized retailers to manage inventory more effectively, reduce stock imbalances, and make better operational decisions using analytics and AI-assisted forecasting. The platform brings together inventory tracking, demand insights, alerts, and a retailer-to-retailer marketplace in one system.

Developed as a university capstone project by **Team OSCORP**, Jiran focuses on improving inventory visibility, enabling data-driven stock movement, and supporting retailers that often rely on disconnected tools such as spreadsheets, POS systems, and manual records.

## Product Overview

Many retailers operate with fragmented systems for stock monitoring, sales tracking, and replenishment planning. Jiran addresses this challenge by providing a single platform where retailers can:

- manage inventory across stores and locations,
- import or synchronize stock and sales data,
- monitor stock health and receive low-stock alerts,
- analyze sales and demand trends,
- identify slow-moving or dead stock, and
- redistribute excess inventory through a built-in marketplace.

The goal of Jiran is to reduce overstocking and stockouts, improve stock visibility, and help retailers make smarter operational decisions using AI-assisted insights.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Inventory Management** for adding, updating, importing, and monitoring stock.
- **AI-Assisted Analytics** for stock classification, demand forecasting, and recommendations.
- **Marketplace / Stock Exchange** for listing excess inventory and requesting stock from other retailers.
- **Low-Stock and Critical-Stock Alerts** to improve operational responsiveness.
- **POS and File Import Support** for integrating data from existing systems.
- **Retailer Dashboard** for operational insights, inventory summaries, and analytics views.

---

## Target Users

Jiran is designed primarily for:

- small and medium-sized retailers,
- businesses operating across multiple locations,
- retailers using systems such as spreadsheets and POS platforms, and
- stores that need better visibility into stock movement and excess inventory.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure the following are installed:

- **Python 3.9+** — https://python.org
- **Node.js 18+** — https://nodejs.org

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harklook/Jiran.git
cd Jiran
```

### 2. Start the project

```bash
./start.sh
```

The startup script will:

- install Python and Node dependencies on first run,
- start the ML backend on **http://localhost:8001**, and
- start the frontend on **http://localhost:5173**.

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop both services.

> **Important:** The application must be running on **http://localhost:5173** for users to access and test the system.

---

## Test Access & Demo Data

Jiran can be tested using either an existing account or a newly created account.

### Option 1: Use the existing demo account

You can log in using the following credentials:

```text
Username: joseg@gmail.com
Password: Hello@1234
```

### Option 2: Create a new account

Alternatively, users can create a new account through the application's sign-up flow and use it to test the platform features.

---

## Testing Inventory and Orders Import

To test the manual import functionality, two sample CSV files are provided:

- **Inventory CSV** — contains **85 items**
- **Orders CSV** — contains **702 orders**

These files can be used to test:

- manual inventory import,
- order import,
- stock updates,
- analytics generation, and
- forecasting-related workflows.

---

## Testing Square Integration

Users can also test the Square integration using the provided demo credentials:

```text
Email: yaasirwheelie2024@gmail.com
Password: -:5UyfdBeJb!@P9
```

> **Note:** The Square demo account currently contains:
>
> - **2 items**
> - **0 orders**

This option is useful for testing the integration flow, but the available dataset is limited compared to the provided CSV files.

---

## Recommended Testing Flow

For the most complete testing experience:

1. Start the application using `./start.sh`
2. Open the frontend at **http://localhost:5173**
3. Log in using the demo account **or** create a new account
4. Import the provided CSV files to populate inventory and order data
5. Explore the following features:
   - inventory management,
   - stock alerts,
   - analytics dashboards,
   - AI-assisted recommendations, and
   - marketplace workflows

## Troubleshooting

### ML models missing

```bash
cd ml_backend && python3 train.py
```

### Port already in use

```bash
lsof -ti:8001 | xargs kill -9
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9
```

### `npm install` fails (macOS)

```bash
xattr -cr frontend/
rm -rf frontend/node_modules
cd frontend && npm install
```

## Notes

- Jiran is an **academic capstone project** focused on inventory optimization, forecasting, and retailer collaboration.
- The current scope emphasizes **inventory operations**, **AI-assisted recommendations**, and **stock exchange workflows**, rather than full ERP replacement.
